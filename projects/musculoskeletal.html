title: "Realtime Musculoskeletal Analysis"
---

<p>I am working on a project that leverages motion capture data to assist caregiving robots, such as robotic arms, in
  aiding patients with mobility limitations. By analyzing motion capture data to estimate muscle tendon use, the project
  aims to support safe autonomous limb repositioning for patients. This work is built within RCareWorld, a robotic
  caregiving simulator developed in Unity by members of the EmPRISE Lab at Cornell University. It integrates Python for
  control software development. The project highlights include
  real-time streaming of motion capture data, musculoskeletal modeling, and live estimation of muscle activations. The
  first step of the project involved streaming live motion capture data from MVN Live, the software used with our motion
  capture hardware. This data was processed in MATLAB, transformed into Unityâ€™s coordinate system, and streamed into the
  Unity simulation using Python. This allowed the real-time mirroring of patient movements by a human model in
  RCareWorld.</p>

  To enable meaningful analysis of patient movements, I integrated a musculoskeletal model into RCareWorld. This model
  features around 300 muscle tendons, each containing nodes at offsets from different bones. The muscle-tendon mechanics
  implement a Hill-type muscle model, capturing contractile, elastic, and series dynamics. Additionally, I built
  software
  to control and receive data from the muscle model in Python. Below is a visualization of
  the muscle tendons and bones in the model and a video of the model in action, actuating the legs with a random set of
  activations sent from Python.

  Using the live motion capture data, I developed a system for estimating muscle activations in real time. By solving
  for the muscle torques that produce specific joint movements, this system minimizes a cost function to provide
  realistic approximations of muscle activations. This work, visualized in Rerun, demonstrates the potential for
  real-time musculoskeletal analysis.
