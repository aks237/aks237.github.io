title: "Audio Interference Car"
---

<p>
  The <strong>Audio Interference Car</strong> was created for an experimental performance by Cornell's Department
  of Music. This robot was designed to create physical and acoustic interference between a speaker emitting different
  frequencies and a microphone, producing unique sounds as part of the performance. Its movement was randomized, and
  it skillfully avoided people in its path using ultrasonic sensors.
</p>
<p>
  The car's structure included a drive base with two motors, wheels, and a caster ball for stability. It supported a
  metal frame with a foam sheet to act as a physical interference medium. This design allowed for dynamic, real-time
  interaction between the speaker and microphone, adding an experimental layer to the performance's sonic experience.

  Below is a video demonstrating the robot's ability to drive around while avoiding obstacles using its ultrasonic
  sensor. This showcases the integration of mechanical design and control algorithms in creating an interactive and
  autonomous system.
