<h5>Kinematic Machine</h5>

<p>
  As part of my mechanical synthesis class, I designed a precise CAD model of an Exact Slider Crank Ellipse and
  Straight-Line Linkage, inspired by a physical model displayed in our engineering school. This project required a
  thorough study of the linkage's kinematics to ensure accurate replication of its motion. The linkage was particularly
  fascinating due to its ability to generate straight-line and elliptical paths, showcasing the elegance of mechanical
  design. Through this project, I honed my skills in both CAD modeling and motion analysis, while gaining a deeper
  appreciation for the ingenuity and historical significance of classic linkage mechanisms in engineering.

<h5>Vacuum Cleaner Pump</h5>

<p>
  In my fluid mechanics class, I created a detailed CAD model of a vacuum pump that had been dissected during a lab
  session. The project involved carefully analyzing the pumpâ€™s internal components and reverse-engineering its design to
  replicate its structure in a digital environment. This exercise not only enhanced my proficiency with CAD software but
  also deepened my understanding of fluid mechanics principles, such as flow paths, pressure differentials, and the
  operational behavior of pumps. By visualizing the internal mechanisms through CAD, I gained valuable insights into the
  functional interplay between moving parts, seals, and housings within the pump.
