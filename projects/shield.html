title: "Shield the Bay"
---

<p>
  <strong>Shield the Bay</strong> was an initiative launched during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to address
  the critical shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) faced by healthcare workers. Led by Berkeley Professor
  <strong>Jaspal Sandhu</strong>, the project focused on the production and distribution of 3D-printed face shield
  visors. These visors were designed to hold clear plastic sheets, forming effective and affordable face guards for
  frontline workers.
</p>
<p>
  I contributed to the initiative by actively 3D printing face shield visors and onboarding other individuals with 3D
  printers to scale up production. Collaborating with a motivated team, we provided essential PPE to healthcare
  facilities, alleviating some of the strain caused by the global supply chain disruptions.

<h2>Impact and Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>
  Shield the Bay was an inspiring example of community-driven innovation during a time of global crisis. By combining
  modern technology, such as 3D printing, with the collaborative spirit of volunteers, we were able to support
  healthcare workers when they needed it most.

  I am grateful to Professor Jaspal Sandhu for his leadership and to the many contributors who joined forces to make
  this initiative a success.
