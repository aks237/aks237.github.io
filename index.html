    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p class="description">
      Hi! I’m Ajay Sunkara, a Master of Engineering student at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering with a
      focus on robots and spacecraft. My passion lies in solving complex problems through simulation and dynamic system
      design, a focus I’ve honed through hands-on projects during my time at Cornell.

    <p class="description">
      I began my academic journey with a focus on civil and environmental engineering, where I conducted research on
      carbon capture methods and contributed to the design and construction of an irrigation system in Tanzania through
      Engineers Without Borders. These experiences sparked my interest in simulating systems to understand their
      behavior, motivating me to pivot to robotics in my junior year. Currently, I focus on harnessing simulation to
      develop advanced control systems. As a member of Cornell’s Mars Rover software team, I contribute to full-stack
      development, from brushless motor control to autonomous navigation. Additionally, I work on real-time
      biomechanical modeling for caregiving robots in the EmPRISE Lab, combining robotics and simulation to address
      complex HRI challenges. Feel free to check out my current and past projects and reach out!
