  MATLAB, Optimal Control, Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics, System Modeling and Simulation

<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>For the final project of my Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics, Estimation, and Control class, I developed and tested a
  linear quadratic regulator (LQR) in a MATLAB simulation I built to control spacecraft thrusters, performing a maneuver
  that negates an initial angular velocity. Using values provided in class (constants listed at the bottom of the page)
  to model the rigid-body dynamics of a spacecraft with four fixed thrusters, I experimented with several different
  control methodologies and achieved the best performance by using a dynamically weighted LQR controller. By adjusting
  the weights for error about each principal axis proportional to the change in error from the previous timestep, the
  controller performs well for both large and small errors in desired angular velocity.

<h5>Dynamics</h5>

<p>
  The rigid-body dynamics of the spacecraft are modeled using its mass, inertial matrix, and center of mass. At each
  timestep, the new orientation and angular velocity of the spacecraft are computed (linear kinematics are modeled as
  well). The four thrusters are mounted at fixed positions (\( {}^{B}\mathbf{r_a} \), \( {}^{B}\mathbf{r_b} \), \(
  {}^{B}\mathbf{r_c} \), \( {}^{B}\mathbf{r_d} \)) along constant unit vectors (\( {}^{B}\mathbf{f_a} \), \(
  {}^{B}\mathbf{f_b} \), \(
  {}^{B}\mathbf{f_c} \), \( {}^{B}\mathbf{f_d} \)) in the body
  frame of the spacecraft. When
  a thruster fires with force \( F \), it produces the following torque on the spacecraft:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \tau_i = ({}^{B}\mathbf{r_i} - {}^{B}\mathbf{r}) \times (F \cdot {}^{B}\mathbf{f_a})
  \]
</p>

<p>
  The total torque acting on the spacecraft is computed by summing the torques from each thruster:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \tau = \sum_{i=a,b,c,d} \tau_i
  \]
</p>

<p>
  Using Euler’s equation, the angular acceleration of the spacecraft can be computed:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \tau = {}^{B}\mathbf{I} \frac{d}{dt} \omega_{B/N} + \omega_{B/N} \times ({}^{B}\mathbf{I} \cdot
  \omega_{B/N})
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \[
  {}^{B}\frac{d}{dt} \omega_{B/N} = {}^{B}\mathbf{I}^{-1} (\tau - \omega_{B/N} \times
  ({}^{B}\mathbf{I} \omega_{B/N}))
  \]
</p>

<p>
  At each timestep of the simulation, the new angular velocity is computed by multiplying the angular acceleration and
  the duration of the step and adding it to the current angular velocity:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \omega_{\text{new } B/N} = \omega_{\text{current } B/N} + \left( {}^{B} \frac{d}{dt} \omega_{B/N} \Delta t
  \right)
  \]
</p>

<p>
  The axis and angle of rotation for each timestep can be computed from the current angular velocity:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  a = \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix}
  = \frac{\omega_{B/N}}{\text{mag}(\omega_{B/N})}
  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega_x^2 + \omega_y^2 + \omega_z^2}} \begin{bmatrix} \omega_x \\ \omega_y \\ \omega_z
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \phi = \Delta t \cdot \sqrt{\omega_x^2 + \omega_y^2 + \omega_z^2}
  \]
</p>

<p>
  The orientation of the spacecraft at each timestep is represented with a quaternion, \( q \), which is updated using
  the axis and angle of rotation.
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \Delta q = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\phi/2) \\ \sin(\phi/2) \cdot a_1 \\ \sin(\phi/2) \cdot a_2 \\ \sin(\phi/2) \cdot a_3
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \[
  q_{\text{new}} = \Delta q \otimes q_{\text{current}}
  \]
</p>

<h5>Controller</h5>

<p>
  To achieve zero angular velocity, an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) is used to control the thruster activations.
  The state space representation of the model is as follows, where \( u \) is a \(4 \times 1\) vector of the thruster
  activations:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  {}^{B} \frac{d}{dt} \omega_{B/N} = A \omega_{B/N} + B u
  \]
</p>

<p>
  Using Euler’s equation, the following state-space representation can be constructed at each timestep the thrusters are
  pulsed:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  {}^{B} \frac{d}{dt} \omega_{B/N} = {}^{B}I^{-1} \tau - {}^{B}I^{-1} \omega_{B/N} \times
  ({}^{B}I
  \omega_{B/N})
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \[
  A = {}^{B} I^{-1} (\omega_{B/N}) \times {}^{B} I \omega_{B/N}
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \[
  B = {}^{B} I^{-1} \tau
  \]
</p>

<p>
  Thruster unit torques is a \(3 \times 4\) matrix where each column represents the torque produced in the body frame of
  the spacecraft by \( 1N \) of force from a thruster:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix} \tau_{i1} \\ \tau_{i2} \\ \tau_{i3} \end{bmatrix}
  = ({}^{B} r_i - {}^{B} r) \times (1N \cdot {}^{B} f_a)
  \]
</p>

<p>
  The LQR minimizes the following cost function:
</p>

<p>
  \[
  J = \int_0^{\infty} (\omega^T Q \omega + u^T R u) dt
  \]
</p>

<p>
  \( Q \) is a \(3 \times 3\) diagonal matrix representing the cost of errors in the angular velocity, and \( R \) is
  the \(4 \times 4\) identity matrix representing the cost of thruster efforts. This helps reduce the thruster effort
  used in the maneuver. The values of \( Q \) are dynamically adjusted at each timestep to weight the error for each
  angular velocity
  component based on how much the error was reduced from the previous timestep. This helps compensate for less
  controllable axes. The resultant gain matrix, \( K \), is multiplied by the current omega error to produce the desired
  thruster
  activations. Each activation is then bounded between \( 0N \) and \( 2N \), the maximum allowable force for each
  thruster. The controller is implemented using MATLAB’s built-in \( lqr(A, B, Q, R) \) function.
</p>

<h5>Simulation</h5>
<p>The timestep for the simulation was 0.1 seconds. At each step, the state of the spacecraft is updated using the above
  equations. To make the maneuver a pulsed maneuver, the LQR controller is only implemented every 5th timestep, making
  the
  “on time” of the maneuver one fifth of the total time. The simulation is visualized on a plot and recorded to produce
  the animation seen above. Additionally, the angular velocities and thruster activations are stored during the
  simulation
  period, producing the following plots:</p>
